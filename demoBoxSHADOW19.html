        The history of Kendrapara is not only replete with a rich heritage but also marked by a plethora of events having far reaching consequences . The presiding deity of this land is Shri Baladev Jew and this place owes its name to the mythological anecdote on ‘Kandarasura’ . Notwithstanding this , the place is surrounded by a cluster of villages and Kendrapara being the village centre, earns the name as central village as is viewed by many learned scholars.</p>
